		<h3>What is Parkour?</h3>
		<p>Parkour is a discipline where its practitioners learn to move throughout their environments safely, efficiently, and gracefully using only their bodies. It's a physical and mental exertion, made to push your limits and open your mind. Control, Repetition, and Progression are key.</p>
