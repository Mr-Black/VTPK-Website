<h2 class="head-title">History of the Virginia Tech Parkour and Freerunning Club</h2>
<p>A long time ago, in a campus far, far away, existed a freshmen who came to conquer the world. This freshmen was in possession of real ultimate power, aka Parkour skills, and wanted to train an army of awesomeness (with which he planned to rule the world, of course.)</p>
<p>This freshmen was Paul 'Leon' Mederos. Together with a small band of roomates (Billy Hay, Brian Richard), he started pouring liquid awesome all around campus. The ranks grew slowly in number... there was Hai Thai, Saylor Alf, Frankie no Socks, Stix, and countless others. Leon decided it was time to BE OFFICIAL. So he went and filed a small piece of paper with the club, and hence VTPK was born.</p>
<p>With the blessings of Gymnastics officer Bryant Burnett, the super pwners were allowed on the gymnastics team to train in the facility. But little did the gymnasts know that this was all part of the plan to slowly achieve global domination. Over time, most members of VTPK also became members of the gymnastics team so they could practice their art inside or out.</p>
<p>As the club raked in soul after soul, it became apparent that 60-person jams were far too large. Structured disorganization came into place as the leaders tore down scheduled times and stood behind spontaneous jams. Twas a good time to be a traceur. The club has at one point held at least 80+ dedicated traceurs in a semester. Now a days the numbers fluctuate between 20 and 50. The legend that was Leon has disappeared, but rumors have it that the masters always keep watch, guiding the newbies as they follow their path to become traceurs and freerunners.</p>
